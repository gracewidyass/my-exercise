# Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property
You can specify the `height` of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the width property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:
```
img {
  height: 20px;
}
```
## Task
Add a `height` property to the `h4` tag and set it to 25px.
