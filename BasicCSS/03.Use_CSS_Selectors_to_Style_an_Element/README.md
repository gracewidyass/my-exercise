# Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements
With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.

When you entered `<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>`, you were styling that individual h2 element with inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS.

At the top of your code, create a `style` block like this:
```
<style>
</style>
```
Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:
```
<style>
  h2 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
```
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces (`{` and `}`) around each element's style rule(s). You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.
## Task 3
Delete your `h2` element's style attribute, and instead create a CSS `style` block. Add the necessary CSS to turn all `h2` elements blue.
