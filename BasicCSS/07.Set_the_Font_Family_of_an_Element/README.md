# Set the Font Family of an Element
You can set which font an element should use, by using the `font-family` property.

For example, if you wanted to set your `h2` element's font to `sans-serif`, you would use the following CSS:
```
h2 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```
## Task 7
Make all of your `p` elements use the `monospace` font.
