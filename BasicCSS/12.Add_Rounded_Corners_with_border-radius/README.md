# Add Rounded Corners with border-radius
Your cat photo currently has sharp corners. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called `border-radius`.
## Task 12
You can specify a `border-radius` with pixels. Give your cat photo a `border-radius` of `10px`.

Note: This challenge allows for multiple possible solutions. For example, you may add `border-radius` to either the `.thick-green-border` class or the `.smaller-image` class.
