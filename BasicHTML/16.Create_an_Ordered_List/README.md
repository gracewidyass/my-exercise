# Create an Ordered List

HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.

Ordered lists start with an opening `<ol>` element, followed by any number of `<li>` elements. Finally, ordered lists are closed with the `</ol>` tag.

For example:
```
<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>
```
would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".
