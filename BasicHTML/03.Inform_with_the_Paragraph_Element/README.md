# Inform with the Paragraph Element

p elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. p is short for "paragraph".

You can create a paragraph element like this:
`<p>I'm a p tag!</p>`

## Task 3

Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text "Hello Paragraph".

As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example `<p></p>` and not `<P></P>`.
