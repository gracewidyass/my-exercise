# Introduction to HTML5 Elements

HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include `main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `video`, `article`, `section` and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

Example usage, a main element with two child elements nested inside it:

```
<main> 
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</main>
```
## Task 8

Create a second p element after the existing p element with the following kitty ipsum text: `Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.`

Then, create a main element and nest the two p elements inside the main element.
